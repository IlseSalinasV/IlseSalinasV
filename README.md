## Hi, I'm Ilse. Nice to meet you. ðŸ‘‹

<!--
**IlseSalinasV/IlseSalinasV** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile. -->

I am a mechatronics engineer with a strong inclination towards data science and statistical analysis. 

This repository showcases practical projects in data analysis and machine learning, where I've applied preprocessing, modeling, and evaluation techniques to solve various problems.
